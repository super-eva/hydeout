* Two ways to create object
```js
let obj = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let obj = {}; // "object literal" syntax
```
```js
// example
let user = {     // an object
  name: "John",  // by key "name" store value "John"
  age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30
};
```
* To remove a property, we can use delete operator:
```js
delete object.name
delete object[name]
```
* Ways to get property value
```js
let user = {
  name : 'eva'
}
console.log(user.name)
console.log(user[name])
```

## Object property

> Most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square brackets.
* Can use variable for object key
```js
let fruit = 'apple';
// key is fruit
let bag = {
   fruit: 5,
}
console.log(bag.fruit);
// key is apple, same as bag1[fruit] = 5
let bag1 = {
   [fruit]: 5,
}
console.log(bag1.apple);
```
* Property value shorthand
```js
// can only write key when key and value are the same
const apple = 'apple';
const banana = 'banana';
const fruits = {
    apple,
    banana,
}
console.log(fruits)
```
* Property name limitation
    * name should be `string` or `symbol`
    * other types will be auto converted to `string`
    * reserved words are allowed as property names.
    ```js
    let obj = {
      0: "test" // same as "0": "test"
    };
    
    // both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string "0")
    alert( obj["0"] ); // test
    alert( obj[0] ); // test (same property)
    ```     
    * special case (see [Prototypal inheritance](https://javascript.info/prototype-inheritance))
    ```js
    let obj = {};
    obj.__proto__ = 5; // assign a number
    alert(obj.__proto__); // [object Object] - the value is an object, didn't work as intended
    ```
 *  Accessing a non-existing property just returns undefined
 ```js
let obj = {
    a: 1,
}
console.log( obj.b); // undefined
// can use in to test if property exists
console.log( 'a' in obj); // true
```
* object will be sorted by the integer order (asc) if they are integer property, otherwise it follows create order
```js
let codes = {
  "49": "Germany",
  "41": "Switzerland",
  "44": "Great Britain",
  // ..,
  "1": "USA"
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49
}
```
```js
// To avoid the automated order, can consider to add '+' before number
let codes = {
  "+49": "Germany",
  "+41": "Switzerland",
  "+44": "Great Britain",
  // ..,
  "+1": "USA"
};

// +'+1' will be converted to original number
for (let code in codes) {
  alert( +code ); // 49, 41, 44, 1
}
```

## Copy by reference
> A variable stores not the object itself, but its “address in memory”, in other words “a reference” to it.
> When an object variable is copied – the reference is copied, the object is not duplicated.
```js
let user = { name: 'John' };
let admin = user;
admin.name = 'Pete'; // changed by the "admin" reference
alert(user.name); // 'Pete', changes are seen from the "user" reference
```
* Two object are the same whey they have same reference. (`==` and `===` have no difference)
```js
let a = {}
let b = {}
console.log( a == b) //false

let c = {}
let d = c
console.log(c == d) //true
```
* `const` object only restrict the object name, propery can still be created or reassigned
```js
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2
}
obj.a = 2 //allowed to assign a new value
obj = {} //it's not allowed
```
## How to clone a object
1. for loop to assign the key to new object
```js
let clone = {}; // the new empty object

// let's copy all user properties into it
for (let key in user) {
  clone[key] = user[key];
}
```
2. Object.assign, it's only for simple clone. If object has nested object, it will need deep clone ([lodash/cloneDeep](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#cloneDeep)).
```js
let user = { name: "John" };
let newUser = Object.assign(user, { name: "Pete", isAdmin: true }); // overwrite name, add isAdmin

//can be also written by ...
let newUser = {...user, name: "Pete", isAdmin: true }
```
