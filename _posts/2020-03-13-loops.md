Loops
--
* `while`
```js
// the condition will be evaluated and coverted to boolean
let i = 3;
while (i) { // when i becomes 0, the condition becomes falsy, and the loop stops
  alert( i );
  i--*
}
```
* `do while`, run first before check the condition
```js
let i = 3;
do {
  alert(i);
  i--;
} while(i);
```
* `for`
```js
for (begin; condition; step) {
  // ... loop body ...
}
```

part  |       |     |
---   |---    | --- |
begin |	i = 0 |	Executes once upon entering the loop.
condition |	i < 3 |	Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops.
body | alert(i)	| Runs again and again while the condition is truthy.
step | i++ |	Executes after the body on each iteration.
  * Any part of `for` can be skipped.
    ```js
    for(; i < 3; i++){
      ...
    }
    for(; i < 3;){
      i++;
    }
    ```
