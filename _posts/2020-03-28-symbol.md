* Object property keys may be either of string type, or of symbol type
```js
// id is a symbol with the description "id"
let id = Symbol("id");
```
* Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with the same description, they are different values. 
The description is just a label that doesnâ€™t affect anything.
```js
let id1 = Symbol("id");
let id2 = Symbol("id");

alert(id1 == id2); // false
```
