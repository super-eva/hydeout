* Object property keys may be either of string type, or of symbol type
```js
// id is a symbol with the description "id"
let id = Symbol("id");
```
* Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with the same description, they are different values. 
The description is just a label that doesn’t affect anything.
```js
let id1 = Symbol("id");
let id2 = Symbol("id");

alert(id1 == id2); // false
```
* Symbols don’t auto-convert to a string
```js
let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string

let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id.toString()); // Symbol(id), now it works

let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id.description); // id
```
* Symbols are skipped by for…in and Object.keys()
```js
let id = Symbol("id");
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  [id]: 123
};

for (let key in user) alert(key); // name, age (no symbols)
```

## What’s the benefit of using Symbol("id") over a string "id"?
> As user objects belongs to another code, and that code also works with them, we shouldn’t just add any fields to it. That’s unsafe. But a symbol cannot be accessed accidentally, the third-party code probably won’t even see it, so it’s probably all right to do.
```js
let user = { // belongs to another code
  name: "John"
};

let id = Symbol("id");

user[id] = 1;

alert( user[id] ); // we can access the data using the symbol as the key
```

## Global symbol
Normally, the symbol with same description are different, global symbol is used for get the same symbol
```js
// read from the global registry
let id = Symbol.for("id"); // if the symbol did not exist, it is created

// read it again (maybe from another part of the code)
let idAgain = Symbol.for("id");

// the same symbol
alert( id === idAgain ); // true
```
* To get description by symbol `Symbol.keyFor(sym)`, only work for gloabl symbol
```js
let globalSymbol = Symbol.for("name");
let localSymbol = Symbol("name");

alert( Symbol.keyFor(globalSymbol) ); // name, global symbol
alert( Symbol.keyFor(localSymbol) ); // undefined, not global

alert( localSymbol.description ); // name
```
