* shorten a number by appending the letter "e"
```js
let thousand = 1e3; // 1 * 1000
let ms = 1e-6; // 1 / 1000000 
```
* Hex, binary and octal numbers
```js
let hex = 0xff; // 255, same as 0xFF
let a = 0b11111111; // binary form of 255
let b = 0o377; // octal form of 255
```
* Number.toString(base), base can be vary from 2 to 36 and default is 10
```js
let num = 255;

alert( num.toString(16) );  // ff
alert( num.toString(2) );   // 11111111

// two dots is to call a method after number, same as (123456).toString(36)
// single dot is not working in this case
123456..toString(36); 
```
* Rounding
  * Math.floor: Rounds down: 3.1 becomes 3, and -1.1 becomes -2.  
  * Math.ceil: Rounds up: 3.1 becomes 4, and -1.1 becomes -1.  
  * Math.round: Rounds to the nearest integer: 3.1 becomes 3, 3.6 becomes 4 and -1.1 becomes -1.   
  * Math.trunc (not supported by Internet Explorer): Removes anything after the decimal point without rounding: 3.1 becomes 3, -1.1 becomes -1.  
  * Rounds to n digits `Number.toFixed(n)` (rounds to the nearest number)
  ```js
  let num = 12.34;
  alert( num.toFixed(1) ); // "12.3", output is string
  ```
* A number is represented in 64-bit format, 
   * 52 are to store digits
   * 11 are to store the position of the decimal point (they are zero for integer numbers), 
   * 1 bit is for the sign.
    ```js
    alert( 1e500 ); // Infinity, infinity value is 1.797693134862315E+308
    ```
* why `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` is false
A number is stored in memory in its binary form. 
In binary form, the division by powers of 2 is guaranteed to work, but 1/10 becomes an endless binary fraction.
Hence, it may have some loss with float calculation.
```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2) //0.30000000000000004
//use toFixed to solve the loss problem
let sum = 0.1 + 0.2;
console.log(+sum.toFixed(2) === 0.3) // true
```
