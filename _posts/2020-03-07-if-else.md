* `if` evaluates the expression and converts the result to `boolean`. Go to [Type Conversion](https://super-eva.github.io/2020/03/01/type-conversions.html) to check boolean conversion.
* `if` can be in one line or wrapped in curly braces, recommend to have block for better readibility
  
  ```js
  if (year == 2015) alert( 'You are right!' );
  ```
  ```js
  if (year == 2015) {
    alert( 'You are right!' );
  }
  ```
* may has `else` when condition is false
  ```js
  if (year == 2015) {
    alert( 'You are right!' );
  } else {
    alert( 'You are wrong!' );
  }
  ```
* several condition `else if`
* conditional operator `?` - conditionally assign a variable 
  ```js
  // if condition is true, return value1, otherwise return value2
  let result = condition ? value1 : value2; 
  ```
  ```js
  //multiple conditional `?`
  let b = 9
  let a = (b > 11) ? '> 11' : 
          (b > 10) ? '> 10' : 
          (b > 9) ? '> 9' : '<= 9'
  ```
  > Replace `if` by `?` is not recommend, `if` has better readibility. Only use `?` when want to assign a value depending on a condition.
